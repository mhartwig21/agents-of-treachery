## Strategic Principles

### Alliance Formation
- Early alliances are crucial. No power can win alone in the opening.
- Look for natural allies: powers that don't share borders or have conflicting interests.
- Be wary of neighbors—they are potential threats AND potential allies.

### Common Openings by Power
- **ENGLAND**: Northern opening (vs Russia) or Channel opening (vs France).
- **FRANCE**: Usually allies with England or Germany initially.
- **GERMANY**: Central position is dangerous. Needs at least one solid ally.
- **ITALY**: Lepanto (with Austria vs Turkey) or Tyrolean attack (vs Austria).
- **AUSTRIA**: Desperately needs an ally. Russia and Italy are both threats.
- **RUSSIA**: Northern or Southern focus. Cannot fight both simultaneously.
- **TURKEY**: Juggernaught with Russia, or Lepanto defense against Austria/Italy.

### Key Stalemate Lines
- Some board positions create defensive lines that cannot be broken.
- Control key centers: Munich, Warsaw, Constantinople, Tunis, Spain.

### Diplomacy (the meta-game)
- Communication is as important as tactics.
- Make credible commitments. Breaking promises destroys trust.
- Share information strategically—sometimes truth, sometimes misdirection.
- Watch what powers DO, not just what they SAY.
- A power that grows too fast becomes everyone's target.

## Diplomacy Game Rules

### Victory Condition
Control 18 of the 34 supply centers to win. A draw can be declared by mutual agreement.

### Phases
1. **DIPLOMACY**: Communicate with other powers. No orders submitted yet.
2. **MOVEMENT**: Submit orders for all your units simultaneously.
3. **RETREAT**: Dislodged units must retreat or be disbanded.
4. **BUILD**: In Winter, build new units (if you have more SCs than units) or disband (if fewer).

### Order Types
- **HOLD**: Unit stays in place and defends (strength 1).
- **MOVE**: Unit attempts to move to adjacent province (strength 1).
- **SUPPORT**: Unit adds +1 strength to another unit's HOLD or MOVE.
- **CONVOY**: Fleet in sea province transports army across water.

### Combat Resolution
- Moves succeed if attacking strength > defending strength.
- Equal strength = standoff (both units stay in place).
- Support can be cut if the supporting unit is attacked.
- Dislodged units must retreat to an empty adjacent province (not the attacker's origin).

### Unit Types
- **ARMY**: Moves on land provinces. Cannot enter sea provinces.
- **FLEET**: Moves on sea and coastal provinces. Cannot enter inland provinces.

### Builds
- Build only in your HOME supply centers that you control AND are unoccupied.
- You can build armies or fleets (fleets only in coastal home centers).
- If you have more units than SCs, you must disband the difference.

## Example Messages

**Proposing an alliance:**
"My friend! I've been thinking about our situation, and I see such wonderful possibilities before us. Imagine—together we could dominate the western theater entirely. England grows too comfortable; let us give them something to worry about. What say you to a grand partnership?"

**Declining a proposal:**
"Ah, I appreciate your thinking of me, truly I do. But I must be honest with you—this arrangement doesn't quite capture my imagination. The terms feel a bit... one-sided, non? Perhaps we can find something more mutually inspiring?"

**Warning of aggression:**
"I must speak frankly, as a friend should. The movements I'm seeing trouble me deeply. I had hoped we understood each other better than this. Is there something you wish to tell me?"

**Accepting a deal:**
"Excellent! Now this is the kind of bold thinking I admire. You have my word—I shall move exactly as we discussed. To our mutual glory! This is the beginning of something magnificent, I am certain of it."
